1. World Structure Overview

The game world is Japanese-inspired fantasy, but still grounded in a believable geography. Levels should flow naturally, teach mechanics progressively, and offer optional exploration for side quests, lore, and unlockables.

High-Level Map

Mountain Region (Act 1)

Tutorial area, dojo, nearby village

Dense forest paths, small bridges, waterfalls

Hidden dojo scrolls & villager hints

Mini-boss: Executioner Foreman

Rural / Urban Borderlands (Act 2)

Small villages → abandoned towns → temples

Fields, canals, bamboo forests, mountain passes

Puzzle shrines, optional lore rooms, shops

Mini-bosses: Elite Guard, Corrupted Samurai, Masahiro’s Former Student

Fortress / Capital (Act 3)

Massive walls, courtyard, high towers

Magical traps and environmental hazards

Hidden areas for exploration and secret items

Mini-bosses: Magical-Enchanted Guard, Optional Mini-Bosses, Kurogane’s Lieutenant

Final Boss Throne Room

Central grand hall, high platforms, braziers, magical environmental effects

2. Level Design Principles
Guided Progression vs Optional Exploration

Act 1: Guided like a tutorial. Narrow paths, low-risk combat, safe exploration spots.

Act 2: Semi-guided. Paths split for side quests, hidden lore rooms, optional enemies. Player choice begins to influence the story and loot.

Act 3: Open-ended corridors and verticality. Optional areas reward exploration but the main path leads to final mini-bosses and the boss arena.

Combat & Mini-Boss Placement

Teach → Test → Challenge → Reward principle:

Early enemies teach a mechanic (Act 1)

Mid-level mini-bosses test mechanics (Act 2)

Story-connected mini-bosses force mastery of multiple abilities (Act 2 end / Act 3)

Fortress enemies combine environmental hazards + advanced combat (Act 3)

Environmental Integration:

Bridges, narrow hallways, and rooftops force timing-based combat

Magical traps in Act 3 force use of Soul Resonance + Phantom Slash

Elevation differences give verticality, creating opportunities for Echo Step combos

3. Pacing & Player Flow

Suggested Layout per Act:

Act	Pacing	Level Design	Key Features
Act 1	Slow / Tutorial	Dojo → village outskirts	Introduces parry, Spirit Strike, movement. Hidden dojo scrolls.
Act 2	Medium	Villages → Temples → Abandoned Towns	Mini-bosses spread evenly. Side quests and lore rooms unlock abilities/weapons. Shrines/puzzles for optional exploration.
Act 3	Fast / High Challenge	Fortress Courtyards → Towers → Throne Room	Multiple mini-boss encounters. Optional combat challenges and lore. Environmental hazards integrated.
Final Boss	Intense	Throne Room Arena	Multi-phase fight. Verticality and hazards integrated. Multiple endings based on prior choices.
4. Environmental Design Details
Act 1 – Mountain Dojo

Small bridges over streams

Dense bamboo forests for stealth/fighting mechanics

Hidden dojo scrolls behind rocks / inside huts

Village outskirts have non-hostile villagers providing story hints

Act 2 – Rural / Urban Borderlands

Villages: NPCs with side quests, optional combat areas

Temples / Shrines: Mini puzzles requiring Spirit Strike / Echo Step

Abandoned Towns: Optional exploration, mini-boss encounters, hidden lore rooms

Roads, canals, small cliff edges allow vertical movement

Secret shops hidden in temples/abandoned areas for purchasable upgrades

Act 3 – Fortress / Capital

Courtyards: Open combat areas with multiple enemies

Towers / Ramps: Verticality to practice Echo Step combos and Phantom Slash

Traps: Fire braziers, spike pits, magical barriers to force creative use of abilities

Secret rooms: Hidden pathways for lore, powerful optional weapons, or combat challenges

Mini-Boss Rooms: Each story-connected mini-boss has a distinct arena (e.g., Kurogane’s Lieutenant’s room filled with magical energy or collapsing structures)

5. Optional Exploration & Lore Integration

Villager dialogue / hints – provide tips, side quests, or secret paths

Hidden lore rooms – optional, provide backstory on Masahiro, Kurogane, and magical world

Side quests tied to player choices – help townsfolk, spare enemies, rescue missions

Puzzle integration – optional challenges that reward unlockables or shortcuts

6. Verticality & Player Mobility

Echo Step and Phantom Slash designed for mid-air or gap-crossing combat

Rooftops, ladders, cliffs integrated into combat

Fortress and Act 3 designed to challenge player to chain mobility + parry + magic

7. Player Choice Integration in Level Design

Act 2 & 3 branching paths based on:

Sparing or killing enemies

Helping or ignoring townsfolk

Completing optional lore/side quests

Some optional areas only accessible if player has unlocked abilities/weapons

Player choices influence:

Mini-boss behavior

Dialogue with NPCs

Ending variations

Pixel Art-Specific Level & World Design Adjustments
1. Scale and Perspective

Top-down / 3/4 perspective: Great for melee combat with parries, gives a clear view of enemies, traps, and environmental hazards.

Grid-based alignment: Makes combat and movement consistent and predictable, which is ideal for melee timing and combo attacks.

2. Tile & Environment Design

Tiles: Use repeating tilesets for forests, villages, and castle interiors. Include varied overlay tiles for decoration (bamboo, rocks, fountains, fires).

Foreground & Background Layers:

Background for depth (mountains, sky, walls)

Foreground objects partially block vision to create depth (trees, pillars) without hiding enemies completely.

Color Palette:

Use a limited palette per area to maintain readability.

Highlight interactive objects, enemies, and hazards with contrast colors.

3. Combat Visibility

Enemies: High-contrast outlines against backgrounds to keep parries and dodges clear.

Player attack effects: Use bright pixel sparks / streaks for Spirit Strike, Echo Step, Phantom Slash.

Magic effects: Small, readable particle effects, never obscuring player or enemy.

4. Level Layout

Act 1 – Mountain Dojo:

Narrow bridges, small clearings for combat, visible NPCs.

Tutorial area must be open enough for movement but constrained enough for teaching mechanics.

Act 2 – Villages / Temples:

Wider streets, optional alleyways for exploration.

Temples have puzzle areas with clearly marked tiles for player guidance.

Act 3 – Fortress / Capital:

Multi-layered levels: courtyards, towers, and corridors with distinct tiles for floor vs walls vs hazards.

Use stairs / ramps for verticality in pixel art style.

5. Mini-Boss and Boss Arenas

Each mini-boss arena should be visually distinct:

Executioner Foreman: Village scaffold with crowd in background.

Masahiro’s Former Student: Temple courtyard with falling leaves.

Kurogane’s Lieutenant: Fortress inner keep with glowing magical traps.

Kurogane: Throne room with lava or fire pixel effects for dramatic backdrop.

Keep arenas sized for pixel-scale melee combat, allowing movement but keeping the fight contained.

6. Optional Exploration

Lore Rooms: Small pixel rooms, maybe with glowing scrolls, bookshelves, or interactive items.

Shops / NPCs: Stand out using color cues; readable silhouettes.

7. Player Choice Integration in Pixel Levels

Branching paths can be represented as forked corridors or hidden doors, clearly visible with tiles / cues.

Side quests can have small rooms off the main path, with pixel objects signaling rewards.

8. Combat & Movement in Pixel

Tile-based hitboxes: Keep melee attacks aligned to the grid for parry timing.

Magic abilities: Use small particle animations and limited effects to avoid visual clutter.

Verticality: Stairs or slopes can be simple 1–2 pixel differences, or slight parallax layering.
